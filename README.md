You are free to use CSS libraries such as Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS.

Use GitHub Projects to keep track of your project
Implement the stories and features

Tips:

Ensure that your code is formatted. The extension Prettier, once setup, will handle all of your formatting. Marks will be deducted if your code is not formatted correctly.

Avoid having large files with many functions in them. Instead, try and create modular, reusable code.
